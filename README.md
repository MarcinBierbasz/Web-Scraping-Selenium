# Web-Scraping-Selenium
This project was made to automatically search and download company information from polish public online database https://wyszukiwarkaregon.stat.gov.pl/ based on company NIP number, using python with selenium library.

Project operates on public Central Statistical Office and was made only for learning purposes. Downloaded informations **were not used for any further processing**.

For testing I used 143 polish state-owned companies where state has 100% share in capital.

For this project to work, it must have chromedriver compatible with version of chrome browser. Necessary driver version can be downloaded from: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
